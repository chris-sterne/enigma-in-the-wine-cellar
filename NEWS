Version 5.1.3 (June 26, 2021)
-----------------------------
Reverted to some original frustrum values to solve near plane mesh
clipping problems.  There brings back the noticeable display distortion
of the original game.

Version 5.1.2 (June 25, 2021)
-----------------------------
Enabled stencil buffer in PlayerView so outdoor object properly masked.
Just for interest: Try aspect ratio of 1.5.
Still not able to avoid passing through mesh of some objects (needs better
object avoidance paths).

Version 5.1.1 (June 23, 2021)
-----------------------------
Fixed other visible player positioning.
Fixed rendering when player on other surfaces. 
Near clipping plane still needs adjustment.

Version 5.1.0 (June 23, 2021)
-----------------------------
Updated OpenGl code to use shaders and buffer objects.
Meshes now rendering in PlayerView.
CellarView startup screen blank for now (can disable in settings).
All game maps, including some test maps, are provided.
Sound effects working.
AboutView uses config.h to get version number.

Version 5.0.1 (June 21, 2021)
-----------------------------
Brought older version code into AutoTools and Git.
Code compiles, but object meshes not rendering.
