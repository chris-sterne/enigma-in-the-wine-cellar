This exploration puzzle game is based on the original Palm OS version.  OpenGL (Mesa 3-D graphics library) is used for image rendering.  The 3D image meshes were created with Blender 2.76b.  The sound effects were created in Vorbis Ogg format using Audacity 2.1.2, and are played using a PulseAudio sound server.  The game was written in C++ using gedit 3.38.1 and Glade 3.38.2, with GTK 3.24.0 for the user interface.
